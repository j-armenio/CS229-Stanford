## Machine Learning definition
*Arthur Samuel (1959)*: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
*Tom Mitchell (1998)* Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

## Machine Learning Strategy (Learning Theory)
When you work in a machine learning project you have a lot of decisions to make, "do you collect more data? Which kind of data?", "do you try a different learning algorithm?", "do you rent faster GPUs to train your learning algorithms for longer?", "which architecture to pick?".

## Deep Learning
The basics of how to train a neural network yourself.

## Unsupervised Learning

## Reinforcement Learning
Let a program figure it out themselves how to solve a problem, and if it do something right, give it a reward.
